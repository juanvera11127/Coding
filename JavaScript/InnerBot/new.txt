$wya (EP):Why'd You Have To Act Like That Though$
*
Isn't it funny how sometimes the best things in life are unexpected?
*
I’ve been trying hard to figure a formula for happiness

And right now it involves a lot less of you.
*
I wouldn't take it personally though, I just have a hard time caring for myself when I'm not alone

But then again if I don’t...
*
I've been missing you

I swear.
*
$wya (EP):Oof$
*
Keep my eyes half open.
*
As I sit, I watch the screen

It teleports me.
*
Who are these people standing in my room?
*
One day, I’ll have the keys.
*
One hand on the wheel

How does it feel?
*
If you wanna lose the time

Do what you almost did

And it’s easy if it’s tight

Focused on your walls.
*
But, I love her all again

Noticed how it is.
*
But, you knew it from the start: uninterested.
*
I’m impressed you can recollect that much.
*
You must be quick

Pulling the rest.
*
As I sit, I watch the screen

It terrifies me.
*
$wya (EP):Six AM$
*
Was supposed to be a casual arrangement

Now I feel as though I'm constantly complaining.
*
That don't make it right, if it makes you feel good.
*
Trying hard to keep the rules that we established.
*
Sometimes it seems like you're the lead and I'm the ad-lib.
*
Used to wake up feeling like I won the lotto.
*
Out of sight, out of mind, that's the motto.
*
$wya (EP):Mushroom$
*
My spores been growing by the day, and

My days been shining too bright.
*
Keep me on the edge of my seat, babe.
*
Tucked away forever dim light.
*
Seems too real

Wanna keep it chill.
*
Hold me near.
*
That sucks, it's a little too close now.
*
Only you can get me to cry.
*
Think I might've said a little too much today.
*
Don't wanna hear about your other guy.
*
All alone in the dark, like a mushroom

That's the way I'm gonna get by.
*
Spare me the awkward little details.
*
Oh no, there's trouble in sight.
*
Something to fill

It's about to spill

What to do? (it's clear).
*
I'm not that mad, babe, I'm just a little upset.
*
$wya (EP):Mate$
*
Listen, maybe you should listen.
*
I don't think you'd like it if I gave you permission.
*
Maybe it's a sign.
*
Lightning in the sky

Now the storms coming, and I think I know why.
*
Back to before

What have I done?
*
Only you can judge me, 'cause sometimes it's fucked.
*
You don't have to be vague.
*
What can I say?

Lately I can only see static and grey.
*
$Underwater+:Woah ft. Bane's World$
*
Why has it stopped, is she really not there?
*
He's alone.

(Wish that I could call you on the phone)
*
I'm awake and aware, but it's out of my hair

Where she goes?
*
Somethings are made to last a while

Either stay or watch it go.
*
Keep me in mind when you're away.
*
I knew it

I'll see you on another day.
*
Dreams of another soul

I'm living a different life.
*
The path can cross, the path can change

And now back to later, maybe we can get together.
*
Now back to later maybe we can get together.
*
$Underwater+:Autophobia$
*
Don't stand to look

At the picture on the wall

Something's telling me it's wrong.
*
So pardon me, and please

When it gets up to this point

I just don't know what to do

I get so confused.
*
$Underwater+:2031$
*
Turn and wait for a brand new day

Things are getting brighter
*
Maybe after all I'll stay

I don't wanna doubt you
*
I can't listen to you lie

It only brings me fear

That everything's my fault.
*
And I know what you like

And I know what you want

And I know what you want

Even if you don't.
*
Don't take it out on me

I've been patiently waiting
*
Running from the endless sheets
*
This is a match made in heaven
*
I can't sit and watch you cry

It only brings me fear

That everything's my fault
*
I'm back and forth again

I'm standing on the flag

But if I bring you joy

Then maybe it's...
*
$Underwater+:Babbadook$
*
I don't think you realize

You talk all the blame
*
I don’t think I'll be on time

I've always been late.
*
Winner takes control

But, you’ve gone on the way.
*
Nothing we haven't done

And it pays to be sad.
*
What do you have to run from?
*
Against the world I'm in.
*
$Underwater+:Fine$
*
Enjoy your time alone

The older you get the harder it is to find.
*
Feet are worn down to the bone

I call you up to tell you what's on my mind.
*
6, 7, 2 hours from now

I'll find a way, somewhere, somehow.
*
What is it to you?

What's in it for me?

I've earned the right to be selfish

Don't you agree?
*
Climbing up the hill

Dont know what I'll see
*
Something tells me

You miss me
*
I'm at loss for words

Waiting

Waiting

Waiting

Waiting

Just dont believe everything you've heard.
*
$Underwater+:Untitled Two$
*
Hello, my dear

How have you been?
*
It's been awhile

Since I could talk

Since I've said much.
*
My mouth's shut closed.
*
My heart is stone.
*
Family comes first.
*
Sometimes it hurts.
*
Hello, good friend

Where have you been?
*
Don't push me away

I'll never leave.
*
I'll always be

Alone.
*
$Underwater+:Second Best$
*
I lost my way and I need to get back

Always in the crib, but I'm stuck to the track.
*
And if you have found you, who am I to say stay?
*
Fine as my church, I don't want second best.
*
It always falls, it always sinks.
*
I'll never fall from talk of anything.
*
And what's my fault?

And what is yours?

I don't care anymore.
*
I miss my life and I wish it'd come back

Its not gonna be simple as that.
*
Cuz if you found your way I don't want second best.
*
If some fresh part that's all I want.
*
And whats the game?

And whats the point?

I don't care anymore.
*
Don't you see you're not my baby?

Don't you see your fault, my baby?
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Eclipse$
*
Try, it's right there for your eyes

If you push, it you can get it in time.
*
I'm the only thing left to hide.
*
I'll reach out to you, you'll reach out to me

I'll be right here waiting.
*
When I talk to you, patience is the key.
*
I'll be right here waiting.
*
I return to you, nothing left for me.
*
Waiting.
*
You do it to yourself.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Twnsion$
*
I'm on a mission to find what I've been missing.
*
I wish she wasn't concerned, but

I'm on a road to higher ground now.
*
Don't wait for me.
*
Always on to the next one

On to the next one

On to the next one

Can't you see a pattern taking shape before your eyes?
*
You and me need a little fun

Progress lost, business won

What we need, intelligence

Rest in peace, sweet conscience.
*
Vultures fly, swoop down low

Catch prey, pick your bones.
*
We were not meant to live like this.
*
We're always tired, always sick.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:I'm Aware$
*
I only wanna make it through today

Is that so hard to ask?
*
Another life lesson learned, okay.
*
It's hard to speak for this.
*
A lover born with no one, and I can speak to you.
*
You never told me what it means to be with you.
*
You've got me all wrong

I never meant to do it, baby.
*
'Cause you've got me all wrong

I'm aware, I'm aware.
*
It just rolls along, I guess.
*
Slow down, slow down.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Jerry$
*
They say good comes to those who wait

Well I've been waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, way too long.
*
I refuse just to let it break

Cause I've been watching you fall apart for way too long.
*
And, it's no surprise, I have thoughts that'll make you shake.
*
I scare myself when I lose my sleep

I start to wander in the middle of the dead night.
*
I've been holding out

I've been watching you again.
*
I've been staring out

Don't call the cops on me, babe.
*
It's never gonna be the same.
*
You're never gonna be the same, I know.
*
My only crime is that I cared.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Discipline$
*
Roll up your filthy sleeves

The pulpit's up here waiting.
*
Sleep is my enemy

I'm more productive when I don't have any rest.
*
Take a good look at me

It might be your last time.
*
Sweetie, come back to me

The father's watching gladly.
*
One day, you'll have to leave.
*
I beg that you pray every night when no one's watching.
*
Rituals are comforting

But only when you choose to believe.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Buffalo$
*
She wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.
*
A jokes a joke until it fucks with you, is it true?
*
There's nothing I would want to hide from you.
*
Another lie, now what am I to do?
*
Mother I'm trying, and I don't know why.
*
It seems I've lost my focus again.
*
It seems like once I think I have it all worked out

Time comes by and washes it down.
*
Strive for what's right, I know I can't hide
*
I know, I can't hide these feelings inside.
*
I can't feel this way

I don't wanna say.
*
Just once, I think I have it all worked out.
*
And your expressions got me, oh, so down.
*
I treat you how I wouldn't want to be treated.
*
Do as I say, not as I do

Oh, I beg you.
*
Another day, another dollar in the bank.
*
Be as I say, not as I am.
*
I fear you are not searching deep enough, yet.
*
I fear you're searching in all the wrong places.
*
Well, my dear, come face to face with what you really feel.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Forest$
*
I let you down baby, yes I said

Down, down, down, the stream.
*
I've seen consciousness break it's concentration on me.
*
Nothing new this side of town.
*
Heard you're missing me

Well, that's news.
*
I thought that we were past that, way past that.
*
I'm the fool who gets out

Forgets the reason for leaving.
*
I don't need nobody else, so get out.
*
I think it's time you start leaving.
*
One more chance for you to leave this mess, 'cause I know.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:People Free$
*
Never wanna go out

You used to scream and shout.
*
You didn't wanna go out

Just to see it passing.
*
You used to never go out at all.
*
I've got everything I need right here in between these four walls.
*
Everything, so clear.
*
No windows in my room, no sun comes in.
*
These limitations are blinding me.
*
Deep inside the center of the city

Evil lurks.
*
Wash away with holy rain

Evil looks.
*
I try to change, but get similar reactions

I think I'll stay where I'm staying at now.
*
Can you read this? My penmanships never been so good.
*
I wouldn't change it even if I could.
*
Let's turn away from the glitch parade

I've had enough of this.
*
I'll burn it down before the end of the day

"Where are we going now?"
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Drowning$
*
I will not let fear control me.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Bower$
*
I've never seen you before.
*
You're gonna walk out? Explain a little more.
*
I wish that there'd be no end.
*
You're hard to train, but it all depends.
*
You make me say it, again:

I don't belong.
*
Yeah, you make me say it.
*
I am done waiting.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Nice One$
*
I wanted to know what you said

So, I looked you up on the phone.
*
If red roses aren't meant for friends

Then, I'm riding home alone.
*
And it's a cold, dark world out there

Isn't what it used to be?
*
I can't control what goes on out there

Frightening just to think of it.
*
Don't you think of it?
*
Unbelievable, so incredible

Welcome to our future land.
*
What's a spectacle?

Why so skeptical

And unattainable as it is?
*
It's worth a damn.
*
Look at me, turn your head

Make your mind, go ahead.
*
Let it go, honestly

Terrible news to hear.
*
All alone once again

Lonely much?
*
Call a friend

Let em know how you feel.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Song 3$
*
The air isn't real

It's made in a lab, shipped in a bag.
*
Reflections aren't real

When digital lights refracting on me.
*
The pain isn't real

Just chemicals telling my brain how I ought to be.
*
Oh, what's the point in tellin' if you're never gonna listen?
*
What's the point in telling you why?
*
Our children will be buried under blankets of snow

And you'll be in your technicolor home.
*
Conscious says,

"Yeah we spoke of this before in a dream of course."
*
It was clear to me then, babe, but now it seems you still want more.
*
He'll regret it

He said he's never felt that

So I'm wondering if you'd let him.
*
He thinks it's coming easy

I know you are prone to dancing when nobody is home.
*
Feels good to be alone

"People free," in his own words.
*
It's not always what it seems to be

I've wandered far too long to tell apart, but now.
*
All I want to do is be.
*
All I want to say is "how?"
*
All I want to do is you.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Conversations$
*
Wait, what are you doing?
*
Tell me your secrets

I will not hold them against you.
*
Didn't they raise you

Better than this?
*
Oh shit, is it over?
*
You missed the point again

Depending on your friends

Trying to make sense.
*
Why are you angry?

I thought you had me

Oh, but, nothing's as it seems.
*
I swear picture it in

Time to break the spell
*
Oh, hell

Witches calling
*
Now that you're older i think you should try it.
*
I know that you feel you are so good at hiding.
*
I'm here to warn you it's time to grow up,

And if you don't evolve you're bound to erupt.
*
You mentioned to me you wanna be someplace where things don't grow.
*
Make something special

The timing is clear.
*
It won't last forever 

Cause nothing is real.
*
Nothing to feel, I don't want to change

Keep it the same.
*
Go forth, my child

Into the daylight.
*
Nothings as it seems

Not anymore.
*
$Underwater Pipe Dreams:Balto$
*
Did you like me more

When I was young?
*
I hid my heart and tried to love.
*
I was incomplete and insecure

I cared too much of what they'd know.
*
Content as can be, no end in sight.
*
Nothing's gone wrong so nothing can go right.
*
I refuse to believe it isn't pure.
*
I only wish to make it work.
*
If I could earn you back with just a song

I'd sing until I could no more.
*
I need a place to sleep

Place to rest my head

Do you have a home?

Can I stay there instead?
*
I used to know who you were

Used to call you by name.
*
Unpredictable life is

You can count on change.
*
I can't sleep at night

I wonder tons.
*
$Sun Transmission:88$
*
I don't wanna see what I can't say.
*
I don't wanna breathe what the earth made.
*
I just wanna be where the hurt stays.
*
One for the fire that you made me

Holding it down, like a black sheep.
*
Guess where it stands isn't so deep.
*
It goes against me.
*
$Sun Transmission:Rosary$
*
One day, all this will make sense.
*
But just promise me you won't ever forget.
*
There are two kinds of men in this world

Ones who move on, stroll on, and ones who never learn.
*
Don't you need me? At least, to tell you what you're worth.
*
I've been waiting too long and, no, it doesn't hurt.
*
To be moving on, strolling along I think that I can learn.
*
Oh we'll see how much you think I'm really worth.
*
Deep down, mysteries can't be solved yet

Can't you see?
*
I got a little black present hiding for ya under your seat.
*
$Sun Transmission:I Almost Lost This$
*
She don't believe me, ever, when I say

Life's indifferent and it's a-ok.
*
We're different and it's all ok.
*
$Sun Transmission:Diamond Eyes$
*
Go to sleep, you'll be fine

Close your eyes forever.
*
Take your time, slow it down

One foot in front of the other.
*
Oh, I know we will all be gone someday

But, until then

Keep those diamond eyes still shining.
*
Lights keep flashing on the other side

You know something that I wouldn't care for.
*
$Sun Transmission:Wild$
*
I was watching you, my girl

Looking lovely, like you would.
*
$Sun Transmission:Interstellar Me$
*
I know how you feel inside

Believe me, it's alright.
*
The feeling's right on time

Your energy's alive

So, stop and look inside.
*
The feeling's right on time

So right.
*
In sync

You run

Can't hide

Begin, describe

This feeling inside, yeah

Which you call me.
*
Will you shine tonight?
*
Your heart is made of gold

Girl, you know I'm sold.
*
$Sun Transmission:Ccbw$
*
Taken back for nothing

Make me a believer.
*
Hold it back for no one

Make me a believer.
*
You found a new life

Below the sunrise.
*
You found a new, new life

Just past the limelight.
*
Move it along now, baby.
*
Taken from what I've seen

She can be mine when it's just

Right

Wrong

Right

Wrong.
*
$Sun Transmission:1 4 2$
*
I've got a problem

I don't know what to do.
*
I can only love her

If she lets me love you too.
*
I'm trying hard to show her

What a man like me could do.
*
If only I could show her

All the things I want to.
*
I think I'm really like you

I hope you're really like me, too.
*
What else can I say, girl?

I miss you all the time.
*
A promise is forever

So, I'll keep yours on my mind.
*
You looked at me so curiously

I never asked you why.
*
I hope that you don't think that I am trying to decide.
*
It tears me up, it puts me out

Head spinning again, again.
*
We fall in love and fall apart again.
*
So here we are

And yes, it's a little bit.
*
Too built up

And no, I ain't feeling this.
*
Can't you see that this trouble?
*
1 4 2 yes, this could be trouble.
*
Too worked up inside to be feeling this.
*
$Blacklight (EP):Blacklight$
*
There are things we can't control

learning to let go ain't easy.
*
I've watched the tide rise and fall

And it doesn't phase me.
*
I must let you know, it doesn't get easier.
*
But, still we try.
*
We can't go back

But, why would you want to?
*
We can't go back.
*
There are things we can't control

I'll let you know when I get past that.
*
Tell me where my dreams will go

If they fall into a million pieces.
*
$Blacklight (EP):Signals$
*
To feel

Only wanna feel your head against mine.
*
So when things get down, take me there.
*
Stay yourself.
*
$III:Change Your Mind$
*
"Because if I've lost my mind, you're really the only person that understands me, so either you're real, or you're an extension of myself, cause you agree with me."
*
"If you've lost everything you've got, what are you gonna do man?"
*
"You've just got to keep moving forward."
*
$III:American Spirits$
*
Call you on the phone

You said, "don't be alone."
*
I'm on my way.
*
Another Friday night, where to now?

I'm on it.
*
Please, don't let me down.
*
We've got the world in our hands.
*
We can drive around, all around the town

So pointless.
*
Maybe it's a waste to drink our nights away

But I love it.
*
I love it.
*
And I know, I might be wrong in holding on too long

But, fuck it.
*
$III:Happy 21$
*
Turn around

Open up that smile

I know it's buried down there deep.
*
Look around

Places change

Along with names I've never heard before.
*
Trust in yourself.
*
Only from within.
*
You trust in yourself to see it from the inside out.
*
But, maybe, you can try and go handle things all on your own.
*
Holding on to something that is real.
*
You need it like a common drug

Pass it down along with us.
*
Trade in all your worries for something real.
*
Safe and sound

Hide inside your inner secrets.
*
All around 21, the age you're seeking.
*
Keep it down, you see it inside out.
*
$III:Feel Better$
*
Down by that place you met her

I hope that you feel better.
*
No worries here on out to me

It's all fine by me.
*
Don't think too much about it

I hope that you don't doubt it.
*
Leave everything alone for me.
*
Damn that old serenade.
*
"Makes me worry 'bout" she said.
*
But when it's time for this, you'll move along.
*
A true romance can't last too long for me.
*
$III:King's Cup / College Curls$
*
Talking bout girls

It's naturally empty.
*
Our friends come and go

They make the most of me.
*
I want you more and more

But, you do not know.
*
Our time is running out

I can't seem to let you go.
*
Oh, when you go, I'll be around.
*
It makes me bleed and cry when things get down.
*
It hurts to know that I'll be on the ground.
*
Dark was the sky

Tingly and cold.
*
Honest is my lie

All my friends are animals.
*
I can't remember when

I don't remember why.
*
I fell inside your web as I looked into your eyes.
*
Not alone

We're not alone.
*
Girl of mine

Why do you leave me?
*
But still I try.
*
It's hard to be here.
*
$III:R.Dkrd$
*
I wouldn't pretend again

So let's show off, instead.
*
Mine isn't a place of hate

So let's turn it around.
*
Don't, she makes you.
*
Don't take me from me

Save me from you.
*
I can't comprehend your head

But don't ever think twice.
*
She doesn't believe in friends

But, who really knows?
*
He wasn't believable

But, who really knows?
*
Don't change your mind

Who really knows?
*
$III:Solar$
*
An invitation to move away from

To crawl back inside

Back where we came from

But, everyone's fine.
*
A stormy outlook

It keeps on coming

But I close my eyes.
*
Don't know the difference between reality and what's inside.
*
But everyone's fine

Fine, as far as I know.
*
And everyone's right

Right, as far as I know.
*
$III:Pseudo$
*
Once, in a million years

We find the one, darling.

We find the one, honey.
*
I thought you would want to stay

But you don't.
*
I can't say it's over

How I wanted more than normal.
*
And it's easy

When it's over now.
*
She said tell me how it feels

But, I don't want to explain.
*
I thought you would've stayed by me

But you won't.
*
I will tell you how it feels to go away.
*
$Rose (SINGLE):Rose$
*
All stares, as she walks into the room.
*
Hopeless as I’ll ever be

I could not know from where I stood.
*
I’m a nuisance

think about it a lot.
*
I used to pray to you

Not sure that you forgot.
*
Oh, son, won’t you listen to your mother?

It would be much easier to understand each other.
*
Time and time again

I’m always looking for the right one.
*
I can help you get there, but I can’t promise an outcome.
*
Don’t you want it?

I can see it

Right there in your eye.
*
Love me, baby

Love me lately

Want you in my life.
*
Oh, dear, won’t you listen to your brother?

It would be much easier if you were like the others.
*
$Lullaby (SINGLE):Lullaby$
*
Open and closed

Entirely honest.
*
I’ve been waiting

I’ll wait for you.
*
Just a few more days

Then it’s through.
*
Don’t you know I hate to ask you why

...but why?
*
All of the feels

You’re in the same place that I wanna be in

All alone.
*
It’s just that I wanna be here

Taking it slow.
*
I’m just taking it slow.
*
All of the feels

You’re in the same place that I was that year.
*
So yesterday I felt so...

Is that what you mean?
*
If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t change a thing.
*
You say I never listen

But, what does that mean?
*
Don’t you know I wouldn’t lie?
*
I wish we would get along, but you’re close to being gone.
*
And now it’s time to look the other way.
*
It’s nothing personal

We need some time alone.
*
So, it goes back again.
*
$Again & Again (SINGLE):Again & Again$
*
I'm alright

I'll be fine.
*
Wake up

My mind is tearing to pieces.
*
When it's all said and done

I am standing alone.
*
She's not here today

It's bound to stay that way.
*
Baby, I'm just crazy

'Cause you won't get out my head.
